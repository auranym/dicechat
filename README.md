# DiceChat: Quick and easy dice rolling with friends

DiceChat is a peer-to-peer chat and dice-rolling web application.
No sign up is necessary. Simply host a room, share the room code with friends,
and start chatting!

## Development

This app was a side project to learn peer-to-peer networking with
[PeerJS](https://peerjs.com/), component development with
[JavaScript Web Components](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_components),
and style-systems through a global CSS stylesheet.

While I learned a lot and had a lot of fun with this app, I don't have any
plans to maintain it or expand upon it. However, I may come back to it if I
have the itch. So, here are some features that I will focus on if I ever
return to this project:

- Give more control over rooms (room size caps, kicking players, etc.)
- Add icons and emotes.
- View current users.
- Use commands outside of the chat.
- Simple character sheet creation; including variables, automatic rolling,
  pasting sections into the chat, sharing/exporting sheets.
